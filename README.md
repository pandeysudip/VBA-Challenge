## Following steps were followed for this study:

* Created a script that loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Conditional formatting that  highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.


*  Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

* Made adjustment on VBA script that  allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

## Used python (xlwings package) to perform the above task
* [python](PythonExcel)
